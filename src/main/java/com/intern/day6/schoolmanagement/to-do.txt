Assignment: Student Management System (Java Console Project)
 Objective
The aim of this project is to help learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, including classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, collections, and user interaction through console-based menus.
 
 Problem Statement
You are appointed as the Class Representative (CR) of your batch. Your teacher has asked you to maintain the student records of your class.
Instead of keeping this data on paper, you will design a Java program called Student Management System that will store and manage student details.
The system should allow:
Adding new students
Updating student marks
Displaying all student records
Exiting the program
 
 Requirements
Use Java Classes and Objects to model the system.
Use an ArrayList (or any collection) to store multiple students.
Use Scanner for user input.
Implement a menu-driven console application.
Ensure proper methods are used for each operation (Add, Update, Display).
 
 Class Design
Class: Student
Fields: rollNo, name, marks
Constructor: initialize the student object
Method: display() → print student details
Class: StudentManagement
Field: ArrayList<Student> → list of all students
Methods:
addStudent(int rollNo, String name, int marks)
updateMarks(int rollNo, int newMarks)
displayAll()
Class: Main
Method: main() → menu for the user to interact with the system
 
 Tasks
Create a Student class with required fields and methods.
Create a StudentManagement class to handle the list of students.
Implement a menu in the Main class with the following options:
Add Student
Update Marks
Display All Students
Exit
Test your program by:
Adding at least 3 students
Updating marks of one student
Displaying all student details
